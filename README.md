#In my last [2013 recap blog post](/archive/2013/12/31/a-very-haacked-2013/) I wrote about the number of steps I recorded with Fitbit last year and the year prior. In case you missed it, they were:

* 2012 - `3,115,606` steps (_Note, I started recording in March_)
* 2013 - `4,577,481` steps

Someone asked me how I got those numbers because the Fitbit dashboard is confusing. Indeed it is. Here's how.

First, when you go to the dashboard, you have to mouse over the section to see the "more info" link.

Then, click on the "Year" tab. But you'll notice that you _still_ don't see summary data. You have to click on the little back link.

There's a brief pause, but the summary totals should show up on bottom.

Unfortunately I can't get the same report for my sleep patterns without paying for the premium account. I might do that if I had tracked my sleep better last year.

Hopefully, if you have a Fitbit, this helps you.
